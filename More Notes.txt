Layout and design of program flow:


For each graph one can set ID, bytes to use,
mask for bytes, bias, scale, and color.

All of this does nothing until the refresh button
is pressed. Then all data for that graph
is recalculated based on the criteria.

Unfortunately the graph has to be totally
refreshed when any one sub graph is changed
because the underlaying frame cache could have
changed. It would be possible to only do the full
refresh upon cache change.

Otherwise they all need to be correlated in the
X dimension. The two choices are to make the X
scale be the # of frames thus found but then
most any value will only change sometimes.
I think a better idea is to parse the frame
cache into unique buckets for each ID found
thus far and thus have a list of lists. Then
make the X scale the # of frames in the largest
ID used in the graph.


The frame sending screen has been added but it is very finicky and hard to use. All values in the whole program should default to decimal unless prefixed with 0x or 0X so a routine should be written to parse string input based on the prefix. It wouldn't hurt to allow for binary at some point too. I think octal is pushing it.
