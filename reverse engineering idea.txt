Colored screen with all 64 bits possible in a frame and the ability to select ranges graphically to designate them as a data item.
This screen would be where the data definitions are edited. Have the ability to load and save the definitions and then apply them
to the incoming data to turn it into a decoded format. 

Reverse engineering helper by asking the user to set a baseline then do actions at beeps. Say, touch nothing then when it beeps
push the lock button then the next time it beeps push unlock then it beeps again and you push lock. During this the system
will process the frames to see if there is a frame that changes reliably when the lock button is pressed or if a new frame shows up.
Or, don't push accelerator then slowly push it at beep then at beep hold it as steady as possible then at next beep slowly back off.
Four types of detectors: 
single toggle - A single event happens back and forth - door lock, brake press detection, etc
multi-toggle - The same basic message has multiple states - gear shifter, wind shield wipers, fan, etc
ramp - The value can fluctuate over a range that is easily controllable up/down - accelerator pedal, RPM, power
taper - The value can change over a range but somewhat slowly - temperature, voltage, etc

Flo-View - Allow user to select one frame ID from the list of all IDs seen so far. Then push a button to set the reference
point (or allow all 8 bytes to be typed in). From this point on the 8x8 bit field plus 8 data byte values will update
according to the current data. This will show which bits are changing and somewhat of the pattern in which they change. 
There should be a way to play forward the frames at a slower speed than they really come in so that it is easier
to find the patterns. Also, it should be possible to either set a reference or to always use the previous frame as reference 
and maybe to switch between those two at will to find patterns.

Once guesses are made about the value of bits for a frame it should be possible to show details for a frame by clicking
on it or something to bring up a screen that shows the details worked out. This allows frames to be decoded and the
decoding checked for potential accuracy.

Picturebox for the 64 bit data view. If it is 8x8 grid and each box is 25 pixels then 25*8 = 200 square
